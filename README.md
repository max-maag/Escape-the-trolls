# Escape the trolls
Entry for [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)'s [25th weekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4vrb8n/weekly_25_escape_the_trolls/).

So far phase 1 (navigating the maze), phase 2 (pushing walls) and bonus 5 (unicode characters) have been implemented.

Run `scala Main -help` to see how to run the program.
